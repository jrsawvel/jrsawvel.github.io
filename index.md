I enjoy making things, such as web apps, food, art, crafts, and essays. 

I like to use computer programming languages, combined with other technologies to build tools. My projects require knowledge across the full stack. I strive to keep my apps simple and useful.

My goal is to make it easy to publish content to the web. My favorite web programs to build and use include:

* [message boards](http://toledotalk.com)
* [wikis](http://jothut.com/cgi-bin/junco.pl/blogpost/36298/19May2014/Junco-Readmemd) - [also at TT](http://toledotalk.com/cgi-bin/tt.pl/article/16/Lewiki_Home)
* [blogs](http://maketoledo.com)
* [image uploaders](http://waxwing.soupmode.com)
* [a private, web-based messaging app](https://soupmode.com)
