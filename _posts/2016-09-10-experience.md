### Other Experience

In the past, I worked as a computer systems administer and programmer at a market research company where I managed Unix and Vax/VMS systems, and I created utilities and web apps. I have older experience with programming languages, such as C, Java, TCL, shell, and DCL. My web projects used Microsoft and Oracle databases.

From late-May 2008 to mid-November 2012, I worked in the education area at the Black Swamp Bird Observatory, which is a tiny non-profit, located along Lake Erie about 30 minutes east of Toledo. I created and maintained the website for the Ohio Young Birders Club. I wrote content, and I edited content, created by students and adults. The site that I created has been replaced, and unfortunately, the content is gone too.
