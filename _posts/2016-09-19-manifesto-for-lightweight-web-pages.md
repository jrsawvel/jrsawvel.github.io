# Manifesto for Lightweight Web Pages



## My screed against web page bloat

---

*June 2016* - Publishers have created a web-abusive, reader-hostile web.

In 2016, single web pages from many media sites ranged from 5 to 10 megabytes in size, but the body of many of these articles was simple text. 

A single web page may make hundreds of requests to JavaScript, trackers, ads, etc. These types of web pages can bog down older CPUs, and they can create a clunky user experience on phones.

Disturbingly, [some](http://www.cjr.org/q_and_a/gingras.php) people [blame](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks) the _web_ or browsers for the slowness, instead of blaming the publishers for creating bloated websites.

Another unfortunate growing trend is that many responsively-designed websites use a tiny font size on phones. This creates an uncomfortable reading experience. 

With each web publishing app that I create, I try to simplify the CSS, eliminate the usage of JavaScript for browsing-only readers, and use a comfortable font size.

Publishers need to create more reader-friendly websites.

Since at least early 2014, I have been thinking about (maybe obsessing over) the individual web article page.

I'll let others explain the frustrations and solutions by excerpting from links that I have collected since 2013, along with adding my own thoughts. Some aspects of each article could appear in the other articles. Overlap.
