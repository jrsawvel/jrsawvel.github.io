I believe that each person should have at least one hobby that involves building or making something.

* [My crochet notes](http://crochet.soupmode.com) - Crocheting has become one of my favorite activities. It's easy, tactile, relaxing, and portable. I can make useful items, such as [hats](http://crochet.soupmode.com/tag/beanie) and [scarves](http://crochet.soupmode.com/scarves-that-i-crocheted-in-20142015), or I can make silly things, such as [snowflakes](http://crochet.soupmode.com/my-first-snowflake) and hyperbolic geometry-related [structures](http://crochet.soupmode.com/crochet-and-hyperbolic-geometry).

* [Making naturally-leavened sourdough bread](http://boghop.com/baking-naturallyleavened-sourdough-bread.html) - This might be my favorite food because of its taste, versatility, and simplicity. I "hatched" my starter in January 2010 at a Zingerman's bread baking class in Ann Arbor. [#bread links and notes](http://jothut.com/cgi-bin/junco.pl/tag/bread)

* [Brewing beer](http://birdbrainsbrewing.com/) - This is a shared hobby with my wife that has taken a hit due to time constraints. Hopefully, we return to this tasty activity soon.

* [Maintaining a backyard garden](http://jothut.com/cgi-bin/junco.pl/tag/garden)

* [Roasting coffee beans](http://boghop.com/roasting-coffee-beans-at-home.html) - I even roasted decaffeinated coffee beans, which turned out shockingly well. This was the first time that I have enjoyed decaf coffee.

* [Making pizza](http://boghop.com/making-pizza.html) - My favorite pizzas remain the ones that I make at home, especially when I use toppings that were made by my wife.

* [#watercolor links and notes](http://jothut.com/cgi-bin/junco.pl/tag/watercolor) - My sketches are weak, therefore they remain private. But it's fun. I like to slow down and observe. For portability, I use a very small watercolor set with a few paints and a waterbrush.
