I believe that each person should have at least one hobby that involves building or making something. 

Some of the things that I like to make include:

### Crocheting

[Crocheting](http://crochet.soupmode.com) has become one of my favorite activities. It's easy, tactile, relaxing, and portable. 

I can make useful items, such as [hats](http://crochet.soupmode.com/tag/beanie), [scarves](http://crochet.soupmode.com/scarves-that-i-crocheted-in-20142015), and even [neckties](http://sawv.org/2017/11/14/crochet-necktie-ideas.html). I can also make silly things, such as [snowflakes](http://crochet.soupmode.com/my-first-snowflake) and hyperbolic geometry-related [structures](http://crochet.soupmode.com/crochet-and-hyperbolic-geometry).


### Bread baking

[Naturally-leavened sourdough bread](http://boghop.com/baking-naturallyleavened-sourdough-bread.html) might be my favorite food because of its taste, versatility, and simplicity. 

I "hatched" my starter in January 2010 at a Zingerman's bread baking class in Ann Arbor. [More bread thoughts](http://boghop.com/2017/01/20/bread-thoughts-january-2017.html).


### Brewing beer

This is a [shared hobby](http://birdbrainsbrewing.com) with my wife who got me interested. 

We've had help from local brewing groups, such as the Glass City Mashers and the Frogtown Hoppers. 

Unfortunately, we have not brewed much lately because of other commitments. Hopefully, we return to this tasty activity soon.


### Gardening

I maintained a produce garden off-and-on through the years, [but in 2014,](http://boghop.com/2014-backyard-garden-notes.html) I modified our tiny backyard to support raised bed square-foot gardening.

I try to [start](http://boghop.com/2017-backyard-garden-notes.html) some plants indoors from seed.


### Roasting coffee

I [roast](http://boghop.com/roasting-coffee-beans-at-home.html) coffee outside, using an old air popcorn poppe.

I even roasted decaffeinated coffee beans, which turned out shockingly well. This was the first time that I have enjoyed decaf coffee.



### Making pizza

Arguments can occur over who makes the best pizza, and which style is the best. I enjoy the pizzas produced by some of the new restaurants in the Toledo area. 

But I prefer [my pizzas](http://boghop.com/making-pizza.html), especially when I use toppings that were either made by my wife or grown in our garden.



### Sketching

Sketching a scene or an object forces me to slow down and see the object well.

Yogi Berra said:

> "You can observe a lot just by watching."

I attempt to make watercolor sketches by using a small, portable paint set and a waterbrush. I'm inspired by the [Urban Sketchers](http://www.urbansketchers.org/), especially [Lapin](http://les-calepins-de-lapin.blogspot.com/).

My sketches are weak, therefore they remain private. But it's fun, [although](http://jothut.com/cgi-bin/junco.pl/blogpost/116/28Jan2017/Possible-Lineup-of-8-to-10-colors-for-a-limited-watercolor-palette) I probably [overthink](http://jothut.com/cgi-bin/junco.pl/blogpost/83901/03Feb2017/Watercolor-links-jan-7-2017) it.



### Spinning

As in spinning fleece (roving) into yarn. At the March 2018 Black Swamp Spinners Guild Market Day & Fiber Fair, I bought a beautiful maple wood spinning wheel. And I bought raw, unwashed fleece from a sheep farmer, located near Pemberville.
