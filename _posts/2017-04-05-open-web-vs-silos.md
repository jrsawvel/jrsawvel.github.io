The "open web" and "silos", those terms are confusing. What do they mean? 

Here's a 2010 post at tantek.com, titled [What is the Open Web?](http://tantek.com/2010/281/b1/what-is-the-open-web).

tantek started or helped to start the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org) movement in 2010. In that 2010 post, he wrote about the open web:

> And that's my rough working definiton of what is the open web. In summary:
* open content and application publishing
* open ability to code and implement the standards that such content depends on
* open access to content, web-applications, web standards implementations (browsers), and the internet.

I like email, rss, and http(s). The first and last are internet protocols. Throw in IRC, ssh, and sftp. More internet protocols. I like APIs and interoperability. IFTTT and brid.gy can act as conduits between the open web and silos. 

I think that the open web means hosting content on one's own domain, and the content is publicly available to all with an internet connection by using a web browser or command prompt tools, such as curl. 

Websites that support the open web should use progressive enhancement to allow their content to be available when JavaScript is disabled or when their article pages are accessed via curl.

But I read blogs that do not use a domain name, except for what Blogger provides, which is like yoursitename.blogspot.com. Is that the open web or a silo? People who use Medium, WordPress, Tumblr, and Blogger without domain name mapping have carved out their own spaces on the internet. That feels like the open web to me. Maybe the open web vs silo debate means different things to different people.

> Funny how "the open web" is now used to refer to closed silos like Blogger, Twitter, and Medium

It's comical that the above opinion is a Twitter post, but that Indieweb user stores his social media posts on his own website, which is how the Indieweb works. Any content posted elsewhere is also posted to the publishers' personal websites. The Indieweb mantra is post on your own site first and then syndicate elsewhere.

Anyway, if someone creates a blog at WordPress.com, which means using the WordPress or Automattic servers to host the content, then the publisher won't need to create a server hosting account with Digital Ocean, Dreamhost, Amazon Web Services, etc, which means the publisher won't need to download, install, configure, and manage the web publishing software. All of the server hosting and software management are conducted by WordPress. 

The publisher is free to focus on a website design theme and publishing content. The publisher's domain name would be yoursite.wordpress.com. Is that the open web or a silo? WordPress supports domain name mapping, which means publishers can buy domain names and point the names to their WordPress accounts, creating yoursite.com. Is the latter more open web than the former even though all hosting is the same? This is what's confusing.

When small publishers such as The Awl moved their content from their own server hosting accounts to Medium, did those publishers move from the open web to a silo even though their domain names remain unchanged? Confusing.

If I host at WordPress.com, Blogger.com, Medium.com, Tumblr.com, DigitalOcean.com, or Amazon.com/aws, how are some hosted solutions considered a silo while others are considered the open web?

Websites that are built as a JavaScript single page applications do not support the open web in my opinion. That's an easy one, regardless of where the site is hosted. When JavaScript is disabled, these sites display nothing. When SPA pages are curled, the downloaded content consists mainly of a link to the JavaScript code. No article content exists when curled.

I store most of my images at Flickr to be embedded into my web posts. That's using a silo to support my open web sites. If Flickr disappeared without warning, then my pages would contain missing images. But I backup my images to DVDs, or I used to, which permits me to retrieve the images to be uploaded to either my own site or to another image hosting service.

I also store some of my images on a server that I pay to use, and I use my own image uploading web app: <http://waxwing.soupmode.com>. My Waxwing JavaScript code works within the browser to lower the quality and size of the images, which reduces the upload time and reduces the amount of space consumed on the server. 

I use servers that are hosted at Hurricane Electric, Digital Ocean, and Amazon. I'm not using a server in my own home, except for my Tor site <http://zwdqwr2p2xwkpbyv.onion>.

When I host at DO or AWS, is that supporting or opposing the open web? I could lose my websites if for some reason the server hosting company deleted my accounts, went out of business, or my credit cart expired.

When a Facebook page is only accessible when logged into Facebook, then that's a silo or closed web. It's odd that some businesses set their Facebook pages to a private setting that excludes people like me who do not have an active Facebook account. 

But if the business's Facebook page is available to everyone, is that the open web or still a silo? The publisher chose to host content at Facebook, instead of at WordPress or Medium. Maybe the publisher is unconcerned about owning a domain name. Maybe the publisher does not want to install and manage software on a server. And small business owners have more important things to be concerned about. Unless some guidelines are violated, the Facebook page will probably last as long as the business. 

Quote by someone:

> "If you aren't paying for something, then you aren't the customer. You're the product being sold."

One aspect of the open web could be that the author's content and actions are not re-purposed by the hosting service and used for targeted advertising. That eliminates Facebook from open web contention.

Some people think that in the future, independent websites won't exist. People, businesses, and orgs will publish on platforms, like Medium.com, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. It's already that way for some small, locally-owned businesses in the Toledo area, which do not have a website with their own domain name. 

An easy example of publishing to a silo is Facebook's Instant Articles, which only functions within Facebook's native app for the phone. I don't think that IA works in the company's native app for tablets. It's phone-app-only. Obviously, IA does not work for the web on any device. 

Facebook's Instant Articles relies on a Facebook-flavored RSS file. RSS is an open web example, but the default RSS feed of websites won't work. CMSs need updated to produce a different RSS file for IA. 

Instant Articles is an interesting publishing mechanism, since updates on the publishers' websites get accepted by IA. But again, it's available on Facebook's native phone app only.

Phone-app-only is not the open web. I don't want to install nor use native apps on the phone except for web and gopher browsers. A theory: [The Open Web is the Answer to App Censorship](http://boghop.com/2017/01/18/the-open-web-is-the-answer-to-app-censorship.html).

The debate will continue, regarding the open web and silos. Most users, publishers, businesses, and other orgs don't care about such trivia. They're too busy with other facets of life. They want to use the easiest tools available that provide the most reach to their readers, fans, customers, and contributors. 

And if the preferred publishing and communicating platform for these users is Faceook, then that is NOT Facebook's fault. It's the fault of the open web geeks for failing to create easier systems.

The Blogosphere of the late 1990s to the mid-aughts was a holistic, organic, decentralized social network of sorts that relied on personal websites, comments, RSS, pingbacks, trackbacks, and blog search engine Technorati. 

Facebook launched in February 2004, but it remained closed to certain email addresses or users until September 2006 when Facebook opened up to everyone. Facebook to the world is only 10-years-old. The internet began in the late 1960s or early 1970s. The web began around 1990. The web became popular to the masses by the mid 1990s. 

The open web fans had a 10- to 15-year headstart on Facebook. And now 10 more years have passed. Automattic/WordPress permit users to download their software for users to customize and install. That supports the open web. WordPress is the most popular CMS. Drupal is popular too. Ghost is relatively new.

People who have built open source products have contributed to the open web. Examples include publishing systems, web servers, database servers, caching servers, programming languages, and frameworks. 

I think that the message boards, such as Hacker News and the Stack Exchange sites contribute to the open and closed web, since discussions help inspire people to build things, and meaty discussions can alter the opinions of makers.

In my opinion, the Indiweb people have done the most to support the open web. The Indieweb attracts new converts every year. 
At the moment, the Indieweb ideas are probably too technical for mass adoption. But the Indieweb is taking a long, slow approach to change. 

We don't know what the next big thing will be. We don't know for certain how people will be creating, sharing, and responding to content five to ten years from now. Hopefully, some of the Indieweb ideas will creep into the mainstream.
