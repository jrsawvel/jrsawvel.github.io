Since at least 2013, I've been slightly obsessed with simplifying the design of the single web page article to make it load faster and to make it easier to read, especially on phones. Web page bloat has become a major irritant, in my opinion.

Here's my manifesto for lightweight web pages. If this doesn't qualify as a manifesto, then it's a screed. It's definitely a frustration for the way that some publishers treat the web.
