Since at least the beginning of 2014, I've become somewhat obsessed with simplifying the design for the single web page article, to make it load faster and to make it easier to read, especially on phones. Web page bloat has become a major irritant, in my opinion.

Here's my manifesto for lightweight web pages. If this doesn't qualify as a manifesto, then it's a screed. It's definitely a frustration for the way that some publishers treat the web.
